# Models 

Processed data and pretrained models will be available later, along with details on how to train and load the models.

This directory contains the model definitions and scripts to train, evaluate and compare the models.

Please take a look at the README file in the **models** folder for more details on how to train and evaluate these models.

Abbreviations in the generated output files:

I: Image set (visual context of the speaker)

T: Target image for which we will generate a new utterance

U: Next utterance (utterance to be generated)

P: Previous utterance (if exists, otherwise <nohs>)

A: Actual previous utterance (without <unk> tokens)

R: Set of utterances referring to the same image in the game

H42: utterance generated by the model trained with seed 42

H1: utterance generated by the model trained with seed 1

H2: utterance generated by the model trained with seed 2

H3: utterance generated by the model trained with seed 3

H4: utterance generated by the model trained with seed 4
