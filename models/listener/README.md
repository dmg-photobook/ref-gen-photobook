This directory contains the model definitions and scripts to preprocess data, train, evaluate and compare the models.

Please take a look at the README file in the **models** folder for more details on how to train and evaluate these models. 

You can download the pretrained listener model from [this link](https://uva.data.surfsara.nl/index.php/s/rpebODK60cEC3FC) (best run).

To preprocess the data for the listener model, please run listener/utils/new_dataset_processor_BERT.py.
